# Overview

This project is a simple "Hello, World!" program, serving as an introductory exercise in my sprint project learning experience. The program outputs a greeting message to the console, demonstrating successful setup of the environment and familiarity with basic syntax.

My purpose for creating this software is to practice the basic processes of writing, documenting, and submitting a functional program, all .while following professional conventions. It establishes the foundational workflow for larger and more complex projects in the future.

Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my text editor to write and test code. Git and Github were used for version control and project organization.

I used Python 3.11.9 for this project.
